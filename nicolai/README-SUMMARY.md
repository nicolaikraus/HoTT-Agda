This is a description of the contents of this folder.
For a general readme, the the parent folder.

Each project (apart from anonymousExistence) required HoTTAgda
to be an "included directory" (i.e. needs to be in the loadpath).

pseudotruncations: Agda code for
  "Constructions with Non-Recursive Higher Inductive Types"

SemiSimp:
  The "usual" approach to define semi-simplicial types in Agda,
  with a postulate which ensures coherence. This is an approximation
  to how one would do this in a 2-level system.

anonymousExistence: Agda code for 
  "Notions of Anonymous Existence in MLTT"
  (j.w.w. Martin Escardo, Thierry Coquand, Thorsten Altenkirch)
  This project comes with its own library (which however is
  an old version of the "real" library - to be resolved in future)

thesis: my PhD thesis Agda code (some parts may not be adapted to the
  newer version of the library yet)
