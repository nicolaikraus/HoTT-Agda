      NOTIONS OF ANONYMOUS EXISTENCE IN MARTIN-LOF TYPE THEORY

Nicolai Kraus, Martin Escardo, Thierry Coquand, Thorsten Altenkirch

This file stays very close to the article. Because of this, not all 
proofs are given in the way that is most elegant for a formalization. 
In fact, often re-ordering statements would lead to a shorter 
presentation. The order that we have chosen in the article makes our 
results, as we hope, understandable and gives sufficient motivation.

This file type check with Agda 2.4.2.5.
