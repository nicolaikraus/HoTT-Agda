This repository is my (Nicolai's) fork of the HoTT library 
  github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda.

The purpose of this repository is to have some of my
code public without polluting the community HoTT library
with my unfinished projects.

My aim is to eventually merge some of my developments into 
the HoTT library if I believe that they could be useful for 
other people.

My projects can be found in the folder 'nicolai'; the rest 
of the fork will be synchronized with the HoTT library.
